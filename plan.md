# Multi-Agent Job Matching System Development Plan

This plan outlines the steps to develop a multi-agent job matching system based on the provided guide.

## 1. Set up the development environment

*   Create a virtual environment.
*   Install the required packages (Flask, CrewAI, requests, etc.).
*   Set up MailHog for local email testing.

## 2. Implement the backend API (Flask/FastAPI)

*   Create a `/submit` endpoint to receive applicant data and resume.
*   Implement a service to save data to a database (SQLite).
*   Create a database schema for applicants.

## 3. Implement the resume parsing agent

*   Extract text from the resume file.
*   Call the Gemini API to parse the resume text.
*   Store the parsed data in the database.

## 4. Implement the job search agent

*   Query external job APIs (or perform web scraping) using the parsed resume data and applicant location.

## 5. Implement the job verification agent

*   Verify that the job posting is still open by making HTTP requests to the job post URL.

## 6. Implement the email composition and delivery agent

*   Compose an email with the top job matches, including job title, description, and link.
*   Include unsubscribe and email frequency update links.
*   Send the email using SMTP.

## 7. Orchestrate the agents with CrewAI

*   Define agents and tasks in CrewAI.
*   Integrate each step as a task.
*   Kickoff the crew when a new application is submitted.

## 8. Deployment and testing

*   Run the Flask server locally.
*   Run MailHog locally and configure SMTP settings.
*   Implement logging and error handling.

## 9. Future enhancements

*   Scaling, user preference management, security, and advanced ranking.
